Covid19 Impact on Industries

Piyush Hemant Talele (@piyusht189)

## Idea 
Covid-19 spread in the whole world, many industrial departments suffered from loses, others got much richer, thus governments policies differentiate to support the economy and have less damage while looking for a vaccine.

How can we visualize this in better way ? 

## Use cases 
* See 2 stateâ€™s industrial data, along with covid data, aligned with time.
* See the heatmap of general USA industrial market.
* Ability to compare states and see the effects of corona in each of them, and within comparison between them.
* See the effects of covid on state wise industrial sector (flow time)
